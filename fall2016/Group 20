Almost all the functions in the folder require the subproblems and rotations given to us from LMS these need to be added to the path.
Also requires the Robot Raconteur, and python 2.7. Also you need to set the move mode to MOVE_MODE_LINEAR in the server serial interface
python file.

You need first to create the "robot" struct in the workspace, by connecting to the server. There is an intilization function that you can 
run immedietly to do this.

your can use the move_arm command to move the arm to a specific position, but you also need to specify the tip orientation you want
(in the x-y plane) and whether you want the suction cup on or off. (3 input arguments)

there are scripts to execute some of our open cna closed loop control as well as the learned skill.

If you want to get the camera working you need the open cv and all the support software the comes with the camera.
